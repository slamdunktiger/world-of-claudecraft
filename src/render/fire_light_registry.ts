// The renderer-side owner of the CONSTANT visible point-light count.
//
// three.js bakes the light counts into every material's program cache key, lit
// materials and unlit ones alike, so the number of VISIBLE point lights must
// never change for the renderer's lifetime: one changed count relinks every
// material drawn in that frame, a measured 100 to 200 ms synchronous stall
// each. `renderer.ts` keeps the registries and the pads; this module owns the
// operations that must not be open-coded per call site: adoption into the
// budget, the reparent that keeps a light out of a cull-toggled group, and the
// pass itself.
//
// Extracted from `renderer.ts` under the monolith ratchet (tests/monolith_budget).

 * the moment the toggle hides its ancestor, and the budget cannot compensate on
 * that frame: it ranks against the ancestry it sees, while the cull sweeps run
 * AFTER the frame's budget pass. So a group flipping from shown to hidden while
 * one of its lights holds a counted slot drops numPointLights for that frame and
 * relinks every lit material drawn in it. Distance does not save it either: the
 * budget counts the nearest `visibleCount` ELIGIBLE lights whatever their range,
 * which only gates whether they shine.
 *
 * Applied mechanically at attach, so the NEXT builder that parents a glow into
 * its own group cannot reintroduce the stall.
